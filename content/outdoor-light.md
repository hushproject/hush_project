        Norfolk is one of the driest counties in the country, but in case of rain we’ve licensed the forty-foot drawing room at Colt’s Lodge as well as the outdoor ceremony area, so that a dry location is always on standby.
        Snugly hemmed by ferns and bluebells, the outdoor wedding ceremony itself is held in a humble woodshed, accented by the sounds of birdsong and rustling leaves. Brought back to life to witness soulmates being joined in union, this magical setting surrounds you in a living confetti of wildflowers and bright foliage, while a subtly-fitted woodland PA system ensures that everyone can hear those all-important words.
      leftcolumn: |-
        Leading on from the wild beauty of the meadows, a manicured lawn and landscaped glade offer ample room for festival and banquet-style drinks, dining and dancing under a marquee of your choosing. As well as glamping for your guests, exclusive cottage accommodation at Colt’s Lodge sleeps up to 11.
        When you’re thinking about having an outdoor wedding in the UK, weather always springs to mind. Any sensible plan for a summer wedding in our fair Isles must have a wet weather option, and here at Hush we’ve got it covered.
