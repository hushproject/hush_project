        With plenty of fresh air and open space, your party can experience something unique, with no interruptions.

        You’ll receive a helping hand from the team at Hush in the run up to the big weekend, so that you always feel supported, but the freedom is yours to plan every detail exactly as you want it.

        Nestled under a canopy of beech and chestnut trees is this former woodshed, and now Norfolk’s most unique fully licensed outdoor venue for civil ceremonies and informal hand fastenings.

        Decorate its faded timbers with swathes of muslin or trails of bunting, garlands of wild flowers, and other finery. Up to 160 guests can be seated in an amphitheatre beneath the woodland canopy, with additional standing room if required.

        Given the unpredictable nature of our English weather we encourage all couples to consider hiring a marquee or other structure for the lawn area at Elderwood. Apart from hosting the wedding breakfast it can double as an alternative reception area after the ceremony, as well as a dance area later in the evening.

        We work with a handful of trusted suppliers who are at the very top of their game. Each provide a very different experience with their structures, from traditional pole marquee, to giant Norwegian Tipis (‘big hats’) to festival style stretch tents..
