        <p>My fiance and I <strong>really love</strong> this app and we've been getting great
          feedback from our close <strong>friends</strong> and family. This is exactly what I
          wanted, I know anyone can easily just make an account on the Knot
          but I'm going to have friends and <strong>family</strong> coming
          in from all places and this helps so much.</p>
